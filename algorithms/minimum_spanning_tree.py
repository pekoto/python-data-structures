    Given an array of points on a 2D plane, give the minimum possible
    cost to connect all points.

    The minimum cost to connect points tells you this is an MST problem.

    To do this, we can use Prim's algorithm.
    Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that lets us
    connect all nodes without a cycle, with minimum cost.

    1. Create an adjaceny list of edges with weights (distances)
    2. Start at any node in the graph
    3. Perform a BFS from that node, using a min heap to get next closest node.

    Time: O(n^2 log n) -- n^2 because we add each neighbor each time, log n for heap.
    Space: O(n^2) -- we could have all nodes in the min heap
