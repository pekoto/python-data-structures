    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is used to solve problems where the solution to the overall problem relies on the solution to overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example are the Fibonacci numbers, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we need to recursively solve for `1...n`, we can tell caching the subproblems will be advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1)\n",
    "fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, `fib(2)` is repeated, as is `fib(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the optimal solution to a problem can be found by finding the optimal solution to its subproblems we call this the __optimal substructure property__."

    "### Dynamic Programming Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Top-down with Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, we set up a cache to store every result. Before jumping into our calculation, we check if an answer exists in the memoization cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_fibonacci(n: int):\n",
    "  memoization_cache = [-1 for x in range(n+1)]\n",
    "  return _calculate_fibonacci(memoization_cache, n)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def _calculate_fibonacci(memoization_cache: list[int], n: int) -> int:\n",
    "  if n < 2:\n",
    "    return n\n",
    "\n",
    "    # if we have already solved this subproblem, simply return the result from the cache\n",
    "  if memoization_cache[n] >= 0:\n",
    "    return memoization_cache[n]\n",
    "\n",
    "  memoization_cache[n] = _calculate_fibonacci(memoization_cache, n-1) +\n",
    "    _calculate_fibonacci(memoization_cache, n-2)\n",
    "  \n",
    "    return memoization_cache[n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Bottom-up Tabulation\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, we start from the simplest subproblem and then build our way up to the solution by filling in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_fibonacci(n):\n",
    "  dp = [0, 1]\n",
    "  for i in range(2, n + 1):\n",
    "    dp.append(dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])\n",
    "\n",
    "  return dp[n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever technique we choose, we should use the same general approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve the problem using recursion\n",
    "2. Apply top-down memoization or bottom-up tabulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing out the recursion tree with method calls can often help you spot the solution."

    "### Unbounded Knapsack\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems involve something like a knapsack but you can take the item __infinite__ times.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Examples__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given a list of profits, weights and capacity, find the maximum profit IF the number of items you can take are unbounded.\n",
    "* Given a rod of length ‘n’, we are asked to cut the rod and sell the pieces in a way that will maximize the profit. We are also given the price of every piece of length.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### General Approach\n",
    "\n",

    "### Longest Common Substring\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern involves finding commonality between 2 strings. For example, the longest common substring, subsequence, edit distance, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Examples__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given two strings ‘s1’ and ‘s2’, find the length of the longest substring which is common in both the strings.\n",
    "*  Given two strings ‘s1’ and ‘s2’, find the length of the longest subsequence which is common in both the strings. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. (s1=abdca, s2=cbda -> 3 (bda))\n",
    "* Given strings s1 and s2, we need to transform s1 into s2 by deleting and inserting characters. Write a function to calculate the count of the minimum number of deletion and insertion operations.\n",
    "*  Given a number sequence, find the length of its Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). In an increasing subsequence, all the elements are in increasing order (from lowest to highest).\n",
    "* Given a number sequence, find the increasing subsequence with the highest sum. Write a method that returns the highest sum.\n",
    "* Given a numberic sequence, find the minimum number of elements that should be deleted to make the remaining sequence sorted.\n",
    "* Given a string and a pattern, write a method to count the number of times the pattern appears in the string as a subsequence.\n",
    "* Calculate the edit distance between 2 strings\n",
    "* Given three strings ‘m’, ‘n’, and ‘p’, write a method to find out if ‘p’ has been formed by interleaving ‘m’ and ‘n’. ‘p’ would be considered interleaving ‘m’ and ‘n’ if it contains all the letters from ‘m’ and ‘n’ and the order of letters is preserved too.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, what we want to do is hold an index for each of the strings, and if the match recurse with 1 + next index. Or try recursing with each index alternatively. Also: if we want to find something like minimum insertions / deletions, consider that this will be related the longest common subsequence. If we need to do something like find maximum increasing sequence, we need to store the previous largest index. If it increases, we try recursing again with this index, and we try in any case skipping this index.\n",
