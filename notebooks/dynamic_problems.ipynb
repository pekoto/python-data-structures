    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is used to solve problems where the solution to the overall problem relies on the solution to overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example are the Fibonacci numbers, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we need to recursively solve for `1...n`, we can tell caching the subproblems will be advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1)\n",
    "fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, `fib(2)` is repeated, as is `fib(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the optimal solution to a problem can be found by finding the optimal solution to its subproblems we call this the __optimal substructure property__."

    "### Dynamic Programming Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Top-down with Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, we set up a cache to store every result. Before jumping into our calculation, we check if an answer exists in the memoization cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_fibonacci(n: int):\n",
    "  memoization_cache = [-1 for x in range(n+1)]\n",
    "  return _calculate_fibonacci(memoization_cache, n)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def _calculate_fibonacci(memoization_cache: list[int], n: int) -> int:\n",
    "  if n < 2:\n",
    "    return n\n",
    "\n",
    "    # if we have already solved this subproblem, simply return the result from the cache\n",
    "  if memoization_cache[n] >= 0:\n",
    "    return memoization_cache[n]\n",
    "\n",
    "  memoization_cache[n] = _calculate_fibonacci(memoization_cache, n-1) +\n",
    "    _calculate_fibonacci(memoization_cache, n-2)\n",
    "  \n",
    "    return memoization_cache[n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Bottom-up Tabulation\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, we start from the simplest subproblem and then build our way up to the solution by filling in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_fibonacci(n):\n",
    "  dp = [0, 1]\n",
    "  for i in range(2, n + 1):\n",
    "    dp.append(dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2])\n",
    "\n",
    "  return dp[n]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever technique we choose, we should use the same general approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Solve the problem using recursion\n",
    "2. Apply top-down memoization or bottom-up tabulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing out the recursion tree with method calls can often help you spot the solution."

    "### Unbounded Knapsack\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems involve something like a knapsack but you can take the item __infinite__ times.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Examples__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given a list of profits, weights and capacity, find the maximum profit IF the number of items you can take are unbounded.\n",
    "* Given a rod of length ‘n’, we are asked to cut the rod and sell the pieces in a way that will maximize the profit. We are also given the price of every piece of length.\n",
    "* Given an infinite supply of ‘n’ coin denominations and a total money amount, we are asked to find the total number of distinct ways to make up that amount.\n",
    "* Given an infinite supply of ‘n’ coin denominations and a total money amount, we are asked to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.\n",
    "* We are given a ribbon of length ‘n’ and a set of possible ribbon lengths. We need to cut the ribbon into the maximum number of pieces that comply with the above-mentioned possible lengths. Write a method that will return the count of pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach is to do a DFS with backtracking. In other words, recurse with the item, but don't increase the index, and then recurse without the item, but do increase the index.\n",
