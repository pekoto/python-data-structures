    "A bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that tells you if `w` is in the set. A bloom filter will return a `definite no` or a `probable yes`. I.e., false positives are possible, but false negatives or not.\n",

    "Using a larger bloom filter (more memory) can reduce the number of false positives return from the bloom filter.\n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of adding the elements to a set, we add the a hash of the elements to the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Bloom Filters Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with a bit array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10\n",
    "    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `k` hash functions to set `k` bits in the array when we add an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hash_one('cat') % 10 = 1\n",
    "hash_two('cat') % 10 = 4\n",
    "hash_three('cat') % 10 = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10\n",
    "    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n",
    "    \n",
    "hash_one('dog') % 10 = 3\n",
    "hash_two('dog') % 10 = 5\n",
    "hash_three('dog') % 10 = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10\n",
    "    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we want to check if `dog` or `cat` is in the bloom filter, we just do the reverse: hash the key and then check if those bits are set to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We could hit false positives, if something else hashes to bits that have been set by other keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "* Get posts users have already seen before recommending new posts\n",
    "* Identify malicious URLs in browser\n",
    "* Reduce disk lookups in DBs for non-existing rows or columns\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "1 MB = ~1000 KB = ~1,000,000 bytes = 8,000,000 / 3 = ~2.6M items/MB\n",
